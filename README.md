# `The Voice Tract Simulation Computer Scientific Model otherwise known as the VTSCSM`

Bare-bones procedural speech synthesis


## Notes
original is from neil tharpen
but when you open the web app, in the text box as this is a bare bones speech synthesis thing, 
not all sounds of the human voice tract work
all phrases that work pretty well
- wɑwɑ luigi (not the actual letter a, the ipa symbol ɑ)
- hello world
- mr webster :)
- hɑppi

in general: use this website https://www.englishtools.org/en/convert-english-words-into-ipa-phonetic-alphabet
and then copy paste the output to the text box, it'll tell you some things dont work so just delete those symbols
